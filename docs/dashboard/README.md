# Dashboard Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for the Headless PM Dashboard project.

## Contents

### Planning Documents
- **[DASHBOARD_PROJECT_PLAN.md](./DASHBOARD_PROJECT_PLAN.md)** - Complete project plan including architecture, tech stack, features, implementation phases, and technical specifications

### Visual Mockups
Located in the `mockups/` folder:

#### Page-Level Mockups
1. **[01-project-overview.txt](./mockups/01-project-overview.txt)** - Main dashboard with epic progress, task distribution, active agents, and recent activity
2. **[02-task-management.txt](./mockups/02-task-management.txt)** - Kanban board, task timeline, and workload analytics
3. **[03-agent-activity.txt](./mockups/03-agent-activity.txt)** - Agent status grid, activity heatmap, and performance metrics
4. **[04-communications.txt](./mockups/04-communications.txt)** - Document timeline, mention network, and communication patterns
5. **[05-analytics.txt](./mockups/05-analytics.txt)** - Velocity metrics, cycle time analysis, and quality metrics
6. **[06-system-health.txt](./mockups/06-system-health.txt)** - Service monitoring, performance metrics, and incident tracking

#### Component-Level Mockups
- **[components-ui-elements.txt](./mockups/components-ui-elements.txt)** - Detailed mockups of individual UI components including epic cards, task cards, agent widgets, charts, filters, and real-time feeds

## Architecture Highlights

### Separation of Concerns
- **Frontend**: React app in `/ui/` folder at main level
- **Backend**: Dashboard-specific APIs in `/src/ui/` folder
- **Complete independence** from main API system

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.1, React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state, built-in React state
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization  
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack for fast development builds
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries with graceful fallbacks

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Updates** - Live data via API polling with efficient caching
2. **Multi-Project Support** - Complete project isolation with context switching
3. **Enhanced Task Management** - Kanban boards with auto-selection and error boundaries
4. **Agent Monitoring** - Activity tracking with UI_ADMIN dashboard user integration
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG-compliant color palette and responsive layouts
6. **Advanced Filtering** - Project-independent task filtering with proper context isolation
7. **Auto-Creation Workflows** - Seamless epic/feature/task creation with auto-selection
8. **Error Recovery** - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallbacks

## Implementation Approach

### Phase-based Development
- **7 phases** over 7 weeks
- **API-first** development approach
- **Component-driven** UI architecture
- **Test-driven** development with E2E coverage

### Data Strategy
- **Read-only** dashboard (no mutations)
- **Existing API reuse** where possible
- **Dashboard-specific endpoints** for analytics
- **Auto-generated API client** with OpenAPI

## Next Steps

1. **Review** mockups and project plan
2. **Approve** architecture and tech stack choices
3. **Begin** Phase 1 implementation (foundation setup)
4. **Iterate** based on feedback and requirements

The mockups provide pixel-level detail for implementation while the project plan ensures proper technical architecture and development process.
